#question one
With this Excercise-1 you will understand What is constructor and the difference between “constructor with no arguments” and “constructor with arguments”. Use of constructor in creation of objects.

Create a class Student with the given instructions

instance variables

name: string

studentId: string

instance methods

 printName: which prints the name of the student to the console

printStudentId: which prints the studentId to the console

Do the following steps

create an empty Student object and assign a name and student Id to that object then print the values by calling printName and printStudentId.

create Student object and initialize the object with a student name and student Id then print the values by calling printName and printStudentId.

Understand the difference between these two ways of creating object

Create two student object

student1 with name: ‘Ravi’ studentId: ‘stu123’

student2 with name: ‘Ravi’ studentId: ‘stu123’

what is hashcode of the object in java? print the hascode of objects student1, student2

 Are student1 and student2 object same?  what is the output of  student1 == student2 

Since contents of objects student1, student2 is same, are they stored in same memory location or differect memory locations.
